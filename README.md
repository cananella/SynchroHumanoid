# SynchroHumanoid

SynchroHumanoid is a unified research stack for humanoid robots that synchronizes **vision**, **language**, and **action** across **simulation** and **real-world** environments with **digital twins** at its core.

This repository is intended as a modular playground for:

- Vision-Language Models (VLM)
- Vision-Language-Action (VLA) policies
- Sim-to-Real transfer for humanoid control
- High-fidelity humanoid digital twin pipelines

---

## Goals

- Build a **single coherent pipeline** from perception → reasoning → control for humanoids.
- Prototype and evaluate **VLM/VLA-based skills** (navigation, manipulation, interaction).
- Validate policies in **simulation first**, then deploy on real hardware with minimal gap.
- Maintain a **digital twin** for repeatable experiments and debugging.
